    "  * Complex: Complex number that includes an imaginary part, such as 8j or 2i\n",
    "* Text\n",
    "  * String or str: Just a section of text, defined between either \"\" or ''\n",
    "* Sequences\n",
    "  * List: a list of objects, can be of any combination of types. List is defined within [] and objects are seperated by commas. For example: [2, \"Hello\", 6.7]\n",
    "  * Tuple: like a list except cannot be modified. Will cover this later. Defined within ()\n",
    "  * Dictonary: like a list except each object has a unique identifier. Defined within {}, object names and values seperated by : and entries seperated by commas. For example {\"name\": \"Georgia\", \"age\": 23}\n",
    "* Binary\n",
    "  * Boolean or Bool: Can either be True or False\n",
    "* Empty objects\n",
    "  * Sequences: if you want to define any of the sequence types for later use you can just create an empty one. For example if you wanted to create an empty list you would: list = []\n",
