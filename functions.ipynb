    "Within the brackets is the arguments of the function that need to be parsed through to the function. You can treat these as temporary variables (we call them local variables); their values will only be stored while that function is running. In this function for area we need the width and height of the rectangle. If simply a name is stated, like for `width` then the function will not run without that argument. In the case of `height=1` we set the default value of height to be 1. So if no arg is called in this place, it will still run and use the default value. \n",
